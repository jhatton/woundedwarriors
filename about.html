<p>John and his company was moving south into Bagdad when ememy fire abruptly suddenly from every direction. His team moved quickly to the nearby buildings when he heard a blast close to him, what sounded like an rpg, exploded near the bottom of the building.  All he felt was being dazed and confused, he passed out seconds later.  When he woke up he was in the MASH unit, he remembered saying that he couldn't feel his legs. The doctor told him that both his legs were blown off and that he would never walk again.</p>
