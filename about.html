<h4>PFC John Smith</h4>
<h5>US Army</h5>
<p>When John Smith joined the military back in 1984, he never realized how much he would love serving his country, like most before him did.  When he woke up he was in the MASH unit, he remembered saying hysterically that he couldn't feel his legs. The doctor told him that both his legs were blown off and that he would never walk again. <strong><a href="donate.html">Please Donate</a></strong> to this charity and to help to with our wounded warriors to have a peace of mind. </p>
