<h4>PFC John Smith</h4>
<h5>US Army</h5>
<p>John and his company was moving south into Bagdad when ememy fire abruptly suddenly from every direction. His team moved quickly to the nearby buildings when he heard a blast close to him, what sounded like an rpg, exploded near the bottom of the building.  All he felt was being dazed and confused, he passed out seconds later.  When he woke up he was in the MASH unit, he remembered saying that he couldn't feel his legs. The doctor told him that both his legs were blown off and that he would never walk again.</p>

<h4>Sgt Mike Bullock</h4>
<h5>US Marines</h5>
<p>Mike had been a Marine going on 10 years and he loved the life. Thinking that he would make a career out of it and retire from the Corp he loved. Two years after that thought, his company was sent to Afghanistan for a one year tour. Shortly after arriving the company was ordered to move against surgents south of Kabul. What the intel didn't show was that the surgents had planted land mines all around the camp, which was unusual for them. </p>
